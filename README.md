# Introduction

A Laravel package for static queue drivers. This allows you to make a static queue which will only return a fixed set of jobs in a loop.
This queue can then be run through [laravel's own queue worker](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/queues#running-the-queue-worker) normally.

# Installation

Install this through [composer](https://getcomposer.org/). Please see composer's documentation for details.

# Testing

Run `composer test`.
